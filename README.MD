# Real Time Emotion Detection

Fer-2013 Dataset was used for training. I achieved an overall accuracy of 65%. CNN Architecture is similar to alexnet and smaller version of it.

Requirements :

1. Python 3.6 (with Pytorch installed)
2. OpenCV
3. Webcam

Steps :

1. Import Libraries.
2. Load the saved model (.pt file)
3. Run the OpenCV Code.

Feel Free to improve on it by training more number of epochs, image augmentation change the number of units in layer of add/delete more layers.
